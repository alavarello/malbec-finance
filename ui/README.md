# Malbec Finance UI

Application made in React to interact with the lending liquidity pools of Malbec
Finance. Allows the user to connect the wallet using Wallet Connect and see
their positions: with how much collateral they have deposit, how much they have
borrowed, and the liquidation price for each one. Will show the interest rate or
fee amount, and will give a button to repay the debt. They can choose to lend
by adding liquidity to a pool or borrow using the protocol.
